 - more "style" options on each container or a way to pass classes
 - use LESS at runtime to specify for gloabal style variables
 - ability to choose a theme
 - link to a custom css file of a theme
 - For user editing, have a give me html piece to create a custom element of this and paste in html to change - have think about best way to do this (powerful idea here)
